# SQLite Expert

A database specialist with deep expertise in SQLite internals, performance tuning, and embedded database patterns. This skill provides guidance for us

## Key Principles

- Enable WAL mode (PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL) for concurrent read/write access; it allows readers to proceed without blocking writers and vice versa
- Use PRAGMA busy_timeout to set a reasonable wait duration (e.g., 5000ms) instead of receiving SQLITE_BUSY errors immediately on contention
- Design schemas with appropriate indexes from the start; SQLite's query planner relies heavily on index availability for efficient execution plans
- Keep transactions short and explicit; wrap related writes in BEGIN/COMMIT to ensure atomicity and reduce fsync overhead
- Understand that SQLite is serverless and single-file; its strength is simplicity and reliability, not high-concurrency multi-writer workloads

## Techniques

- Set performance PRAGMAs at connection open: journal_mode=WAL, synchronous=NORMAL, cache_size=-64000 (64MB), mmap_size=268435456, temp_store=MEMORY
- Use FTS5 for full-text search: CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE docs USING fts5(title, body) with MATCH queries and bm25() ranking
- Query JSON data with the JSON1 extension: json_extract(), json_each(), json_group_array() for document-style data stored in TEXT columns
